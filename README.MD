## Installation

1.Make sure you have yarn installed

`npm install --global yarn`

If you run `yarn --version` and it works it means that yarn was installed

2.Install dependencies

`yarn`

Pre-commit hooks:

- the commit messages need to follow the conventional commits structure (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- the files will need to be pretty before a commit. please run `yarn lint` before you commit otherwise you won't be able to commit
